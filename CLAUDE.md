# Merchant Management Console — Project Memory

## Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS (vanilla), hosted on Vercel
- **Backend**: Vercel serverless functions (`api/*.js`, ES modules)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) — project ID `zuzwljjrppyrzngmhdru`
- **Email**: Postmark (`POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN`)
- **GHL (GoHighLevel)**: whitelabel at `app.mypayprotec.com`, API keys stored encrypted in `app_config` table
- **Session**: `pp_session_token` in localStorage, validated against `staff_sessions` table
- **Git**: feature branch `claude/hey-hey-hey-hey-YuBH9`, also push to `main`

## Core Principles (user-stated)
- "What we do here is healing, improving and securing, not changing the current functionalities"
- Always retain existing manual processes — add new features alongside, never replace
- No storing files in Supabase database (use GHL or external storage instead)

## Key Config
- `app_config` table stores secrets encrypted with AES-256-GCM (key = SHA-256 of `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`)
- Supabase Edge Function `ghl-media-upload` (version 3) handles GHL file uploads — uploads to "Secure Files" folder in GHL media library
- GHL notes tagged `[DOC]` are used for partner document tracking (no Supabase storage)

## Planned Feature: ShipStation Integration

**Status**: Phases 1-2 COMPLETE as of 2026-06-26. Phases 3-5 pending.
- Phase 1: DB migration (additive columns + shipstation_shipments table + order seq)
- Phase 2: Deployment modal ship-to toggle + auto-fill + save-back (DONE)
  - `api/deployments.js`: new `getShipInfo` action (merchant + partner auto-resolve via agent_id chain); `create` extended with `ship_to_type`/`ship_to_partner_id` + whitelisted save-back (`merchant_updates`/`partner_updates`) for both single & bulk
  - `deployments-dashboard.html`: shipping destination section in New Deployment modal (toggle, auto-fill, editable blanks, save-back checkbox)
- Phase 3 (next): dashboard badges (🏪 Direct / 🤝 Via Partner) + two-leg partner_received_date milestone in edit modal
- Phase 4: returns modal (single-leg ship_from_type)
- Phase 5: ShipStation API (order create, label, webhook). Backtrack/reconcile existing deployments by matching ShipStation tracking number ↔ `deployments.tracking_id`.

### Locked-in Design Decisions (user-confirmed 2026-06-26)
- **Everything stays tied to `merchant_id`** — the deployment/return ownership never changes. We only add a *shipping destination distinction*.
- **Distinction lives on the parent `deployments`/`returns` row** (not per-item) — one destination per shipment, so single + bulk behave identically.
- **Deployments = two-leg tracking** (user chose "track both legs"): partner leg + merchant leg, derived from dates. Existing `status` enum (`Open`/`In Transit`/`Closed`) is UNTOUCHED.
  - Direct: Open → In Transit → 🏪 merchant received (`merchant_received_date`)
  - Via partner: Open → ✈️ in transit to partner → 🤝 partner received (`partner_received_date`) → 🏪 merchant installed (`merchant_received_date`)
- **Returns = single-leg** (user clarified): either merchant or partner ships back directly, always tied to merchant record. `ship_from_type` records who sent it. No second-leg date.
- **Partner is ALWAYS the merchant's own agent** — auto-resolved from `merchants.agent_id → agent_identifiers.id_string → agents.id → persons (parent_agent_id)`. No manual partner picking.
- **Entry point = INSIDE the existing New Deployment / New Return modal** (a toggle), NOT a separate tab. (Original "separate tab" plan superseded.)
- **Auto-fill + save-back for BOTH merchant & partner**: pick merchant → fills name/email/phone/address; blanks are editable; on confirm, missing values UPDATE the record.
- **Order number = distinct, customizable SS-sequence** (`SS-10001`...) via `shipstation_order_seq`, tied to deployment/return via FK. Custom override allowed. (ShipStation `orderNumber` is what we send; `orderId`/`shipmentId` are SS-internal, returned after creation.)

### Address Logic
- Merchant address/contact ALL already exist: `merchant_address/city/state/zip/country`, `dba_name`, `email`, `merchant_primary_contact`, `merchant_phone` → no merchant schema change needed.
- Partner (`persons`) already had `full_name`, `email`, `phone_number` → only address fields were added.

### Phase 1 schema APPLIED (migration `shipstation_phase1_schema`)
```sql
-- persons: + address, city, state, zip, country (country default 'US')
-- deployments: + ship_to_type text default 'merchant', ship_to_partner_id uuid→persons, partner_received_date date
-- returns: + ship_from_type text default 'merchant', ship_from_partner_id uuid→persons
-- CREATE SEQUENCE shipstation_order_seq START 10001
-- CREATE TABLE shipstation_shipments (
--   id, order_number, ss_order_id, ss_shipment_id, ss_return_id, ss_label_url,
--   tracking_number, carrier, service, ship_type ('outbound'|'return_label'),
--   merchant_id→merchants, deployment_id→deployments, return_id→returns,
--   ship_to_name, address, city, state, zip, country default 'US',
--   status default 'created', created_by, created_at )
--   + indexes on merchant_id, deployment_id, return_id, tracking_number
```

### Existing tables — only ADDITIVE columns, existing rows default to 'merchant'/'merchant'
- `deployments` / `returns` — only the additive columns above; all current logic untouched
- Manual deploy/return flow remains 100% intact

### ShipStation API
- Auth: HTTP Basic (base64 of `api_key:api_secret`)
- Keys stored in `app_config` as `SHIPSTATION_API_KEY` and `SHIPSTATION_API_SECRET`
- Create order: `POST https://ssapi.shipstation.com/orders/createorder`
- Get carriers: `GET https://ssapi.shipstation.com/carriers`
- Webhook: ShipStation fires `SHIP_NOTIFY` on shipment — update `shipstation_shipments.status` + `tracking_number`

### UI Flow (revised — toggle inside existing modal, NOT a separate tab)
1. In the existing New Deployment / New Return modal, select merchant (as today)
2. Toggle: **Ship to merchant directly** (default) vs **Ship to partner first** (deployments) / merchant-or-partner origin (returns)
3. Auto-fill name/email/phone/address from merchant (and partner via agent_id chain); blanks editable; on confirm missing values save back to the record
4. Select equipment (single or bulk — unchanged)
5. (ShipStation phase) order number auto = `SS-####` (customizable), pick carrier + service
6. Review → Create → tracking written back into existing `tracking_id` + `shipstation_shipments`
7. Dashboard shows badge 🏪 Direct / 🤝 Via [Partner]; partner-first deployments show partner-received milestone

### Webhook Handler
- New endpoint: `api/shipstation-webhook.js`
- Verifies shared secret from query param or header
- Matches `ss_order_id` → updates `shipstation_shipments` status
